   Using:

   Run commands, navigate directories (cd), execute build scripts, use Git commands, and see command outputs.
   Advantages Over External Terminal:
   Contextual Integration: No need to switch windows; terminal is within VS Code.
   Seamless Navigation: Opens at project root, easy file navigation.
   Workflow Efficiency: Supports VS Code tasks, debugging, clickable links, and customization.
   Performance: Can perform better with VS Code integrations and large outputs.

7. File and Folder Management:
   - Explain how to create, open, and manage files and folders in VS Code. How can users navigate between different files and directories efficiently?
      Creating:

   Files: Use Ctrl + N (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + N (macOS), or right-click in the Explorer sidebar and choose New File.
   Folders: Right-click in the Explorer sidebar and select New Folder.
   Opening:

   Files: Double-click in the Explorer sidebar or use Ctrl + P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + P (macOS) and start typing the filename.
   Folders: Navigate in the Explorer sidebar.
   Managing:

   Renaming: Right-click and choose Rename, or press F2.
   Deleting: Right-click and choose Delete, or press Delete after selecting.
   Moving/Copying: Drag within the Explorer sidebar or use file system commands.
   Efficient Navigation:
   Between Files: Use Ctrl + Tab (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Tab (macOS) to cycle through open files, or Ctrl + P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + P (macOS) and start typing to use Quick Open.
   Within Files: Use Ctrl + G (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + G (macOS) to go to a specific line.
   Between Directories: Navigate in the Explorer sidebar or use Ctrl + P (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + P (macOS) and type > for File Navigator.
   Additional Tips:
   Search: Use Ctrl + Shift + F (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + F (macOS) to search across files.
   Multi-Cursor Editing: Use Alt + click (Windows/Linux) or Option + click (macOS) to edit multiple locations simultaneously.

8. Settings and Preferences:
   - Where can users find and customize settings in VS Code? Provide examples of how to change the theme, font size, and keybindings.
         Settings Location:

      Access settings via File -> Preferences -> Settings (on Windows).
      Alternatively, use the shortcut Ctrl + , (Windows).
      Customizing Settings:

      Change Theme:

      Search for "Color Theme" in the settings search bar.
      Click on the dropdown under "Color Theme" to choose a different theme.
      Adjust Font Size:

      Search for "Font Size" in the settings search bar.
      Adjust the "Editor: Font Size" setting to change the font size.
      Modify Keybindings:

      Search for "Keybindings" in the settings search bar.
      Click on "Open Keyboard Shortcuts" to view and modify keybindings.

9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?
         Prepare Your Tools:

      Make sure you have VS Code installed on your computer. It's like a special tool that helps you write and fix your code.
      Open Your Project:

      Open VS Code and go to the folder where your program (or project) is saved. This is like opening a book to the right page where your story (code) is written.
      Set Up Debugging:

      Create a file that tells VS Code how to check for problems. This file is like a map that guides VS Code to where the problems might be hiding.
      Find Problems:

      Set markers called "breakpoints" in the code. These are like sticky notes that tell VS Code to stop and look closely at that part of the code when it's running.
      Start Debugging:

      Press a button to start looking for problems. VS Code starts running the program, and when it reaches a breakpoint, it stops and shows you exactly what's happening at that moment in the program.
      Investigate and Fix:

      Look at different parts of the program: check what values variables have, how functions are working, and so on. If something is wrong, change the code right there in VS Code and try running it again to see if you fixed the problem.
      Use Helpful Tools:

      VS Code has tools to help you, like showing you exactly where in the program the problem is, letting you check what different parts of the code are doing, and even giving you a place to type commands to check things while the program is running.

10. Using Source Control:
   - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.
         Integrating Git with VS Code for version control involves several steps, including initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub. Here's a straightforward guide:

      Initializing a Repository:
      Open VS Code:

      Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.
      Open or Create a Project:

      Open the folder or create a new project in VS Code where you want to initialize the Git repository.
      Open the Source Control View:

      Click on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or use Ctrl+Shift+G).
      Initialize Git Repository:

      Click on the Initialize Repository button or type a commit message to start initializing the repository. Alternatively, you can open the integrated terminal (`Ctrl+``) and use Git commands:
                  git init
      Making Commits:
Stage Changes:

In the Source Control view, you'll see a list of changes. Click the + button next to each file or use Stage All Changes to stage all changes.
Write Commit Message:

Enter a summary of your changes in the textbox that says "Message (press Ctrl+Enter to commit)".
Commit Changes:

Click the checkmark icon (✓) to commit the staged changes. Alternatively, use Ctrl+Enter.
Pushing Changes to GitHub:
Create a GitHub Repository:

Go to GitHub and create a new repository if you haven't already. Note down the repository URL.
Add Remote Repository URL:

In VS Code, open the integrated terminal (`Ctrl+``) and use the following command to add your GitHub repository as the remote:
git remote add origin <repository_url>
Replace <repository_url> with your GitHub repository URL.
Push Commits to GitHub:

After committing changes locally, push them to GitHub:
git push -u origin main
This command pushes your commits from the main branch (or master branch, depending on your default branch settings) to the origin remote (GitHub repository).
Enter GitHub Credentials:

If prompted, enter your GitHub username and password (or personal access token if using two-factor authentication).
Verify Changes on GitHub:

Refresh your GitHub repository page in a web browser to see your changes.

 Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide screenshots or step-by-step instructions where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by 1st July
